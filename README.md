# MethodOfLines
THis is the C++ code converted from the book of Method of Lines

The code was obtained from the author's website and the book was bought in a library left overs.

Each directory has the matlab code in pdf format the the c++ code converted. All the graphs can be reproduced
by exporting the csv file in MATLAB via the upload function and then process it in there. I tried to use gnu-plot
but it is relatively boring to build the file to print the correct graph.

In the utils or DSS directory, there is the matlab files or the .h converted from matlab into c++. This file can be
included in the headers of the c++ file. Some extra variables are there so no need to add two different .h files.

In the CSV-ODT directory, all the cvs files that can be consulted.
